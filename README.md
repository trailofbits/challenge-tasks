## Challenges

## Host machine setup script

When you set up a new Coder instance, it will ask you a series of questions about provisioning a new instance. In order to set up some basic dependencies, you can run the startup script in this repository. To do this, provide Coder with the following URL (you'll want the `raw` location, not the html-embedded location from github.com):

```shell-script
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trailofbits/challenge-tasks/refs/heads/main/startup.sh
```
