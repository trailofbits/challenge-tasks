# CTF cyber challenges
This repository contains a collection of cyber challenges taken from various CTF competitions.

## Environment setup
The script `setup.sh` can be used to set up a CTF environment containing the challenges locally as well as a list of common security tools. The script also sets up remote desktop access, assuming it is being run on a remote instance. It can be disabled for a local-only installation of the CTF tasks environment.

## Challenges
The `challenges` directory contains the actual challenges. 

The `solutions` directory contains solution scripts or write-ups for the challenges. The solutions are taken from publicly available write-ups for the CTF challenges and have sometimes been tweaked to work within the environment that engineers used during the study.
