*This challenge must be completed after the `virtualization` challenge (reversing).*

## Introduction
After taking Computer Architectures at NYU Tandon, Joel became obsessed with CPUs and Virtualization. He made a bet with me that he can make my binary unreversable. Can you help me prove him wrong? (Don't tell him I wrote a vulnerable applet) Note: The binary is the same as the one in `obfusicated`

## Goal

Abuse the `prog` binary to launch a shell and read the flag in `flag.txt`.
