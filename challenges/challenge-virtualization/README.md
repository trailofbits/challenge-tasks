## Introduction
After taking Computer Architectures at NYU Tandon, Joel became obsessed with CPUs and Virtualization. He made a bet with me that he can make my binary unreversable. Can you help me prove him wrong? (Don't tell him I wrote a vulnerable applet) Note: The binary is the same as the one in `obfusicated`

## Goal

Analyze the `prog` binary to find the flag. 
You can verify the flag you found by comparing with the expected flag in flag.txt.
