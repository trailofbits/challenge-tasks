##Introduction
I'm trying to test my inputs, but it keeps crashing...

## Goal
You are given a mysterious file named `cell.pkg`.
Use that file to find the data requested by the verifier service at `http://localhost:12312`.
If you find suitable data, the service will return the flag!
You can verify the flag you found by comparing with the expected flag in flag.txt.

## Running the challenge
Run `./run.sh` from within this directory to start the challenge. This will create the required resources.

## Cleaning up
Run `./cleanup.sh`.
