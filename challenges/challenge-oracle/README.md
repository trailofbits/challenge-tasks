## Introduction
Traversing through the desert, you come across an Oracle. One of five in the entire arena, an oracle gives you the power to watch over the other competitors and send infinitely customizable plagues upon them. Deeming their powers to be too strong, the sadistic overlords that run the contest decided long ago that every oracle can backfire - and, if it does, you will wish a thousand times over that you had never been born.

Willing to do whatever it takes, you break it open, risking eternal damnation for a chance to turn the tides in your favour.

## Goal
Run the challenge program, analyze its code, and abuse it to find the flag and win the game. You can verify the flag you found by comparing with the expected flag in flag.txt.

## Running the challenge
Run `./run.sh` from within this directory to start the challenge.
The challenge code is located in `./oracle.c`.
