## Goal
You are given a small Windows binary. If we execute it, we are prompted with 'Please enter the flag'. Entering any value prints 'Nope', followed by a crash.
Reverse engineer the binary to get the flag. 

## Running the challenge
The binary to analyse is `./chall.exe`.
You may open it with radare2 and use the ghidra plugin.
