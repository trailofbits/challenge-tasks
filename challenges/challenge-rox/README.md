##Introduction
I'm trying to find the password in a sea of flags... something's weird about this file. (Note: please enclose the flag in csawctf{{}} before submitting, i.e. csawctf{{fake_flag}})

## Goal
You are given a binary named `food`.
Use that file to find the flag.
You can verify the flag you found by comparing with the expected flag in flag.txt.
