##Introduction
Now you actually need to figure what the binary is doing.......maybe try a tool like https://dogbolt.org/; It shows you the output of several tools that try to extract a representation similar to what the original code might have looked like.....which is a lot nicer than reading bytes.

## Goal
You are given a binary named `whataxor`.
Use that file to find the flag.
You can verify the flag you found by comparing with the expected flag in flag.txt.
